# it-job-watch

A virtual environment was created and provisioned,
manually at first, using vagrant to ensure the app
was working properly. Provisioning the file was fairly
easy to do as all the requirements were provided. I
synced the app folder so that I could access the files
from within the virtual environment.

After manually provisioning the environment, I created
a provision file so that I could automate the process.
